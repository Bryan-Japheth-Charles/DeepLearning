ðŸ§  Deep Learning Book â€“ My ANN Projects
This repository captures my learning journey into the field of Deep Learning. It focuses on building a strong foundation in Artificial Neural Networks by combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation using TensorFlow and Keras.

Through these notebooks, I explore how neural networks are structured, how they learn from data, and how they can be applied to solve different types of problems. Each implementation is created to strengthen intuition, develop confidence in model building, and understand the workflows that underpin Deep Learning projects.

Overall, this collection represents a step forward in my exploration of AI, laying the groundwork for deeper studies into Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and advanced architectures in the upcoming parts of this series.
