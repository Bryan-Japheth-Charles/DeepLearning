# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Book â€“ My ANN Projects

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Book repository**, where I document my learning journey and practical implementations in Deep Learning using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## ðŸ“š What's inside?

### ðŸ”¶ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

- âœ… Implementations for **linear**, **non-linear**, and **classification problems** using ANN.
- âœ… **Iris dataset prediction** using ANN architecture.
- âœ… Hands-on notebooks explaining:
  - Model creation
  - Compilation and training
  - Evaluation and prediction
  - Visualisation of metrics and results

Each notebook is created with clarity to strengthen core concepts in Artificial Neural Networks for beginners and practitioners.

## âœ¨ Upcoming

This repository is the **first part** of my Deep Learning series. I will continue to expand it with:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (**CNN**)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (**RNN**)
- Advanced architectures and projects

making this repo a **comprehensive practical book for Deep Learning**.

## ðŸ”— Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### ðŸš€ Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebooks in **Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab / Colab**
3. Run each cell sequentially to understand the flow
